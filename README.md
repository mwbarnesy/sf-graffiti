# San Francisco Graffiti
This project looks at 311 data provided by the City of San Francisco. 311 is a service center for citizens to report anything that needs attention, ranging from overflowing garbage cans to graffiti on a mail box. I focused on graffiti because San Francisco has a rich cultural history surrounding graffiti, and it influenced me as a young artist.

I used Jupyter Notebook (Pandas) for the analyses, and Seaborn for the visualizations.

<h4>Primary Questions:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Has reported graffiti increased or decreased since the inception of 311?</li>
  <li>Which neighborhoods have the highest count of graffiti?</li>
  <li>What months have the highest volume of reports? Which days?</li>
  <li>Do the incidents cluster in a particular area? What kind of property is being damaged?</li>
  <li>Some entries label the graffiti as offensive, what can we learn about this?</li>
  <li>What data can we bring in to accompany our findings?</li>
